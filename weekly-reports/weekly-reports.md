# Sara Zaki's Weekly Reports

## Week 1 (8/24 - 8/31)

This week has been very exciting for me - from learning how to use Rhino to printing my very first 3D model. At first, I was just going to re-create the 3D phone stand from class, but then I thought I could create my own instead. The plan was to design a 3D stand for dancers, with a mechanical revolving top that uses motion tracking technology, which would make it easier for dancers to record their dance routines. But obviously, I was getting ahead of myself because there was no way I'd be able to create something like that, given my current skill set and level, in such a short amount of time. Nevertheless, it's the thought that counts :)

I made a rough sketch of what I wanted it to look like. Not as detailed as I'd hoped but right now I'm working on improving my sketching skills. I, then, took the measurements of my phone, allowing for some wiggle room around the phone holding area of the stand. I tried to desiign the ephone case directly in RHino and failed several times. After many attemps, I tried to design it in Fusion360 instead, where I found success on the second try. So, I took my learnings from the Fusion360 and applied them to my designs in Rhino. Little progress was made, but gradually, I think I got the hang of it. I spent numerous hours tinkering with the software before I was able to fully design the 3D phone stand, luckily. To be honest, if I were asked to redo the design exactly the same way in Rhino, I think I'd be lost. I'm still watchcing tutorials on how to use Rhino properly and don't even get me started on Grasshopper. I still can't wrap my head around it. But I won't stop trying. Someday, hopefully in the near future, I know I'll be able to effectively use Rhino to create whatever design I can dream of andd I can't wait for that day to come.

The rapid evolution of 3D design tools is both promising and challenging. In the near future, we can anticipate more accessible and user-friendly interfaces. Machine learning and AI integration might help streamline the design process, offering real-time suggestions and automation for intricate tasks like Grasshopper scripting. Additionally, cloud-based collaboration and real-time rendering capabilities could become standard features, making it easier for designers to work together seamlessly across the globe. The convergence of augmented reality (AR) and 3D modeling tools might also offer exciting opportunities for more immersive and interactive design experiences. In the coming weeks, I aspire to delve deeper into mastering Rhino and explore Grasshopper with determination. Grasshopper's visual programming paradigm may become less daunting with practice, and its potential for parametric design will probably unlock new creative dimensions for me. In the future, I hope to incorporate emerging technologies such as sensor fusion and gesture recognition, enabling my 3D phone stand to respond dynamically to the dancer's movements. This fusion of design and technology holds the potential to revolutionize the field of performance recording. Additionally, I will dedicate my time to improving my sketching skills. As I navigate the evolving landscape of 3D design, I shall embrace the challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation.

Recently, I came across an exciting development in the field of 3D design and manufacturing. Adidas, the renowned sportswear company, has unveiled a project called "Futurecraft.STRUNG." They have created a 3D-printed performance shoe upper using a new technique called "strung" which involves robotic threading of textile material to create intricate and customized designs. This not only showcases the capabilities of 3D printing but also highlights the potential for personalized, high-performance products in the sports industry. This innovation is inspiring as it demonstrates how 3D design and printing technologies are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in product design and manufacturing. It's a reminder of how the skills we are developing in this class can have a real impact on industries beyond just 3D modeling and can lead to groundbreaking advancements in various fields.
